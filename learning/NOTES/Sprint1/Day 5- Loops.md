📘 Sprint 1 – Python Core
📖 Day 5 – Loops (for & while)
🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, I should be able to:

Understand why loops are needed.
Use for loops.
Use while loops.
Use the range() function.
Iterate over strings.
Understand nested loops.
Avoid infinite loops.
Analyze the time complexity of simple loops.
💼 Business Requirement

Many real-world applications perform the same task repeatedly.

In Wanderlust Wings, loops will be used to:

Display travel packages.
Process booking lists.
Show itinerary details.
Generate reports.
Display AI recommendations.
Iterate through API responses.

Instead of writing the same code multiple times, loops automate repetition.

📚 Theory Notes
1. What is a Loop?

A loop repeatedly executes a block of code until a condition is met.

Python provides two main types of loops:

for loop
while loop
2. for Loop

Use a for loop when the number of iterations is known.

Syntax

for variable in iterable:
    statement

Example

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

Output

0
1
2
3
4
3. range() Function
One Argument
range(5)

Produces

0 1 2 3 4
Two Arguments
range(2, 6)

Produces

2 3 4 5
Three Arguments
range(2, 11, 2)

Produces

2 4 6 8 10
4. Looping Through Strings

Strings are iterable.

Example

name = "Python"

for letter in name:
    print(letter)

Output

P
y
t
h
o
n
5. while Loop

Use a while loop when the number of iterations is unknown.

Syntax

while condition:
    statement

Example

count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
6. Infinite Loop

An infinite loop never stops because the condition never becomes False.

Example

count = 1

while count <= 5:
    print(count)

This loop runs forever because count never changes.

7. Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.

Example

for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)

Nested loops are useful for working with matrices, patterns, tables, and grids.

☕ Java Developer's Perspective
Java	Python
for(int i=0; i<5; i++)	for i in range(5):
while(condition)	while condition:
Uses braces {}	Uses indentation
i++	i += 1
❌ Mistakes I Made
Mistake 1

Initially, I was unfamiliar with how range() works.

Correct Concept

The stop value in range() is exclusive.

range(5)

Produces

0 1 2 3 4
Mistake 2

The FizzBuzz problem requires checking divisibility by both 3 and 5 first.

Correct order:

if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:

Then

elif i % 3 == 0:

Then

elif i % 5 == 0:

Checking the combined condition first prevents incorrect output for numbers like 15.

Mistake 3

Variable names can be more descriptive.

Instead of

table

A better choice is

table_number

Clear variable names improve readability.

Mistake 4

Console output can be made more user-friendly.

Instead of

7*3 = 21

Prefer

7 × 3 = 21

Small formatting improvements make programs easier to read.

⭐ Best Practices
Use for when the number of iterations is known.
Use while when the number of iterations depends on a condition.
Choose descriptive variable names.
Avoid infinite loops.
Keep loop bodies simple.
Use proper indentation.
Think about time complexity when writing loops.
🎯 Interview Questions with Short Answers
1. What is a loop?

Answer

A loop repeatedly executes a block of code until a condition is met.

2. Difference between for and while?

Answer

for is used when the number of iterations is known.
while is used when the loop depends on a condition.
3. What does range(5) return?

Answer

A sequence containing:

0 1 2 3 4
4. Why does range() exclude the last value?

Answer

The stop value is exclusive, which simplifies counting and indexing.

5. What is an infinite loop?

Answer

A loop whose condition never becomes False.

6. What is a nested loop?

Answer

A loop inside another loop.

7. Time Complexity of a simple for loop?

Answer

O(n)

8. Space Complexity of a simple for loop?

Answer

O(1)

🔑 Key Takeaways
Loops eliminate repetitive code.
Use for for fixed iterations.
Use while for condition-based repetition.
range() excludes the stop value.
Strings are iterable.
Nested loops solve multi-level iteration problems.
Infinite loops occur when the condition never changes.
Always consider the efficiency of loops.
🔥 Common Interview Traps

❌ Assuming range(5) includes 5.

Correct:

0 1 2 3 4

❌ Forgetting to update the loop variable inside a while loop.

This causes an infinite loop.

❌ Checking Fizz or Buzz before FizzBuzz.

Correct order:

if divisible by both
elif divisible by 3
elif divisible by 5

❌ Writing unnecessary repeated code instead of using loops.

✅ Day 5 Summary

Today I learned how to automate repetitive tasks using loops. I understood the difference between for and while loops, learned how range() works, iterated through strings, explored nested loops, and understood the risks of infinite loops. I successfully built a package viewer, generated multiplication tables, solved the FizzBuzz problem, and combined loops with conditional statements to solve interview-style coding problems.

⭐ Tech Lead Notes

Day 5 was the first lesson where you began thinking in algorithmic patterns rather than individual statements. Your FizzBuzz solution showed that you understood the importance of condition ordering, and your loop-based programs were clean and readable. From this point onward, you'll start using loops together with data structures, which is how real applications process collections of information.

🏁 End of Day 5

Congratulations! 🎉 You have completed:

✅ Day 1 – Python Fundamentals
✅ Day 2 – Operators & Expressions
✅ Day 3 – User Input & Strings
✅ Day 4 – Control Statements
✅ Day 5 – Loops

Day 6 – Lists

You'll learn:

Creating Lists
Indexing
Slicing

Looping through Lists
Nested Lists
Real-world collection handling

This is a major milestone because Lists are the first data structure you'll use extensively in Wanderlust Wings for travel packages, bookings, itineraries, and API responses. Happy coding! 🚀
